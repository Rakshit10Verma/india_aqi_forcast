# Project: Predictive Modeling of Air Quality in India

## Overview
This project aims to build a reliable machine learning model to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) in major Indian cities. By predicting high-pollution events 24-48 hours in advance, this tool can serve as a basis for public health advisories and inform policy decisions. This project is developed as part of the "End-to-End Data Science" curriculum.

## Problem Statement
Severe air pollution is a critical public health issue in India, leading to widespread respiratory illnesses. A key challenge is the lack of timely, accessible forecasts that would allow citizens and authorities to take preventive measures. This project addresses this gap by leveraging historical air quality and meteorological data to build a predictive model.
